    fullDescription: `1k Miles of Hope is a fundraising initiative created to support cancer research through the Terry Fox Foundation — one of the most impactful cancer research programs in the world.

The goal is simple: run 1,000 miles and raise funds that go directly toward financing scientific research aimed at finding a cure. Every kilometer translates into real resources for real scientists working on real breakthroughs.

Cancer touches almost every family. This campaign is a way to turn movement into meaning — to make every run, every mile, and every step count for something larger than the finish line.

If you want to contribute, every donation makes a difference.`,
